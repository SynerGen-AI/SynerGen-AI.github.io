- **Fine-tuning Support**: Easy fine-tuning for domain-specific applications
- **Efficient Inference**: Optimized for both quality and speed

## Technical Specifications

- **Model Size**: 7B parameters
- **Context Length**: 8,192 tokens
- **Training Data**: 500GB of curated text data
- **Framework**: PyTorch with Hugging Face Transformers
- **Hardware Requirements**: 16GB+ GPU memory for inference

## Performance

Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks:

- **BLEU Score**: 42.3 on WMT translation tasks
- **Perplexity**: 15.2 on WikiText-103
- **Human Evaluation**: 8.7/10 for coherence and creativity

## Getting Started

```python
from synergen import NeuralTextGenerator

# Initialize the model
model = NeuralTextGenerator.from_pretrained('synergen/neural-text-generator')

# Generate text
output = model.generate(
    prompt="The future of artificial intelligence",
    max_length=200,
    temperature=0.8
)

print(output)
```
